# Enhanced CBM Dashboard Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) dashboard system currently implemented for vessel equipment monitoring. Our analysis has identified several critical data connection issues that are limiting the dashboard's effectiveness and analytical capabilities. We have also developed a detailed enhancement strategy to address these issues and significantly improve the dashboard's functionality, data handling, and visualization capabilities.

The current CBM dashboard monitors 4 vessels with 59 pieces of equipment, tracking various condition parameters from January 2023 to April 2025. While the dashboard provides basic monitoring capabilities, our analysis reveals substantial opportunities for improvement in data handling, equipment hierarchy management, parameter extraction, and visualization capabilities.

## Current System Overview

The CBM monitoring dashboard currently provides:

1. **Basic Fleet Monitoring**: Tracks 4 vessels with 59 pieces of equipment
2. **Time-Based Tracking**: Monitors readings from January 22, 2023 to April 4, 2025
3. **Equipment Status**: Shows capacity percentages by vessel and equipment type
4. **Reading Status**: Displays both taken and missed readings
5. **Monthly Trends**: Visualizes equipment status by month

The dashboard uses Excel files as data sources, with a Power Query transformation process to prepare the data for visualization. The data structure follows a hierarchical model:

1. **Vessel** (e.g., CD ULSAN, H GAETA)
2. **Equipment** identified by MP_NUMBER (Measurement Point Number)
3. **Component** identified by COMP_NAME (Component Name)
4. **Measurements** including vibration, bearing, and shaft parameters

## Data Connection Issues Analysis

Our detailed analysis has identified eight critical data connection issues that are limiting the dashboard's effectiveness:

### 1. Vessel Name Extraction Issues

The dashboard extracts vessel names directly from filenames rather than from a dedicated field within the data. This leads to inconsistencies as filenames include "CBM" which is not part of the vessel name. For example, "CD ULSAN CBM.xls" becomes "CD ULSAN CBM" instead of just "CD ULSAN".

### 2. Date and Time Parsing Challenges

The dashboard attempts to handle various date formats but has significant limitations in processing Excel's numeric date values and complex date/time transformations. This results in incorrect time series data visualization, chronological sorting issues, and inaccurate "days since reading" calculations.

### 3. Limited Parameter Extraction

The dashboard only extracts 5 parameters out of over 100 available columns in the data files. Critical bearing-specific measurements (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF) and shaft condition parameters (unbalance, misalignment, looseness) are ignored, significantly limiting the dashboard's analytical capabilities.

### 4. Equipment Code and Component Handling Issues

The dashboard uses `MP_NUMBER` as the equipment code without properly establishing relationships between equipment and components. This prevents proper equipment filtering, grouping, and hierarchical navigation, making it difficult to compare similar equipment across vessels.

### 5. Missing Data Validation

The code lacks proper validation for imported data, with minimal handling of missing values and no error reporting for malformed data. This leads to unreliable dashboard behavior with inconsistent data and potential for incorrect calculations or visualizations.

### 6. Inefficient Data Processing

The data processing approach is inefficient, with sequential file processing and all data kept in memory. This causes slow dashboard loading times, poor performance with large datasets, and memory consumption issues.

### 7. Limited Data Visualization Capabilities

The dashboard uses only basic line charts with no advanced analytics, statistical processing, or comparison capabilities between different parameters. This limits insight generation and makes it difficult to identify patterns or trends.

### 8. Missing Equipment Hierarchy

The dashboard lacks a proper equipment hierarchy structure with clear parent-child relationships between vessels, equipment, and components. This makes navigation and analysis difficult and prevents fleet-wide equipment type analysis.

## Data Structure Analysis

Our analysis of the Excel data files revealed a rich data structure that is not being fully utilized:

### Measurement Parameters

The data contains numerous measurement parameters categorized as:

1. **Vibration Measurements**
   - Displacement (Disp, Rms)
   - Velocity (Vel, Rms)
   - Acceleration (Acc, Rms)
   - Peak and Peak-to-Peak values

2. **Bearing Condition Parameters**
   - BPFO (Ball Pass Frequency Outer race)
   - BPFI (Ball Pass Frequency Inner race)
   - BSF (Ball Spin Frequency)
   - FTF (Fundamental Train Frequency)
   - Bearing-specific measurements for DE (Drive End) and NDE (Non-Drive End)

3. **Shaft Condition Parameters**
   - Unbalance
   - Misalignment
   - Looseness (multiple types)
   - Harmonic analysis

### Equipment Hierarchy

The data reveals a natural hierarchy that should be implemented in the dashboard:

1. **Vessel Level** (e.g., CD ULSAN, H GAETA)
2. **System Level** (e.g., Cooling, Lubrication, Air)
3. **Equipment Level** (e.g., Pumps, Compressors, Motors)
4. **Component Level** (e.g., Bearings, Shafts, Impellers)
5. **Measurement Point Level** (specific locations where measurements are taken)

### Equipment Types

The data includes various equipment types that should be categorized for better analysis:

1. **Pumps**: Cooling water, lubrication oil, fuel oil, fire/bilge
2. **Motors**: Drive motors for various pumps and equipment
3. **Compressors**: Air compressors, refrigeration
4. **Purifiers**: Lubrication oil, fuel oil
5. **Blowers**: Ventilation, combustion air

## Enhancement Strategy
