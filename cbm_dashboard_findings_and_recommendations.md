# CBM Dashboard Enhancement Project: Findings and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document presents the comprehensive findings and recommendations from our analysis and enhancement of the Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) dashboard. We identified several critical data connection issues in the original dashboard that limited its effectiveness and analytical capabilities. Based on these findings, we developed an enhanced dashboard that addresses these issues and significantly improves functionality, data handling, and visualization capabilities.

The enhanced dashboard provides a more robust and user-friendly interface for monitoring vessel equipment conditions, with improved data processing, comprehensive parameter extraction, proper equipment hierarchy implementation, and advanced visualization capabilities. These enhancements enable more effective condition-based monitoring and maintenance planning for the fleet.

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Structure Analysis

Our analysis of the CBM data revealed a rich hierarchical structure that was not being fully utilized in the original dashboard:

- **Vessel Level**: The data covers 4 vessels (including CD ULSAN and H GAETA)
- **Equipment Level**: 59 pieces of equipment identified by MP_NUMBER (Measurement Point Number)
- **Component Level**: Various components identified by COMP_NAME (Component Name)
- **Measurement Parameters**: Over 100 different measurement parameters categorized as:
  - Vibration measurements (displacement, velocity, acceleration)
  - Bearing condition parameters (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF)
  - Shaft condition parameters (unbalance, misalignment, looseness)

### 2. Data Connection Issues

We identified eight critical data connection issues in the original dashboard:

1. **Vessel Name Extraction Issues**: The dashboard extracted vessel names from filenames, leading to inconsistencies as filenames included "CBM" which is not part of the vessel name.

2. **Date and Time Parsing Challenges**: The dashboard had significant limitations in processing Excel's numeric date values and complex date/time transformations.

3. **Limited Parameter Extraction**: The dashboard only extracted 5 parameters out of over 100 available columns in the data files.

4. **Equipment Code and Component Handling Issues**: The dashboard lacked proper relationships between equipment and components.

5. **Missing Data Validation**: The code lacked proper validation for imported data, with minimal handling of missing values.

6. **Inefficient Data Processing**: The data processing approach was inefficient, with sequential file processing and all data kept in memory.

7. **Limited Data Visualization Capabilities**: The dashboard used only basic line charts with no advanced analytics or statistical processing.

8. **Missing Equipment Hierarchy**: The dashboard lacked a proper equipment hierarchy structure with clear parent-child relationships.

### 3. Enhancement Implementation

Based on our findings, we implemented a comprehensive set of enhancements:

1. **Improved Data Parsing and Extraction**:
   - Proper vessel name extraction with validation
   - Robust date/time parsing with Excel format handling
   - Comprehensive parameter extraction categorized by type
   - Dynamic parameter selection in the UI

2. **Enhanced Data Structure and Relationships**:
   - Proper equipment hierarchy: Vessel > System > Equipment > Component
   - Tree-based navigation structure in the UI
   - Structured format for efficient filtering
   - Visual hierarchy indicators in the dashboard

3. **Performance and Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Parallel file processing
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Optimized memory usage
   - Data persistence using localStorage

4. **Enhanced Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Multiple chart types (line, bar, scatter)
   - Multi-parameter visualization
   - Statistical analysis (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Parameter distribution visualization

5. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Intuitive filtering and navigation
   - Clear visual indicators for data quality and status
   - Comprehensive statistical information

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis and enhancement work, we recommend the following actions to further improve the CBM monitoring system:

### 1. Data Collection and Management

1. **Standardize Data Collection**: Implement a standardized data collection process across all vessels to ensure consistency in parameter measurements and naming conventions.

2. **Automated Data Validation**: Develop automated data validation routines to identify and flag potentially erroneous readings at the point of collection.

3. **Centralized Data Repository**: Establish a centralized database for storing all CBM data rather than relying on individual Excel files, which would improve data management, access, and analysis capabilities.

4. **Real-time Data Integration**: Consider implementing real-time data feeds from vessels when possible, reducing the delay between measurement and analysis.

### 2. Dashboard Enhancement

1. **Predictive Maintenance Algorithms**: Integrate predictive maintenance algorithms that can analyze trends and patterns to predict potential equipment failures before they occur.

2. **Threshold-based Alerting**: Implement threshold-based alerting for critical parameters to provide early warning of potential issues.

3. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the dashboard for mobile devices to enable monitoring and analysis from anywhere.

4. **User Role Management**: Implement user role management to provide different levels of access and functionality based on user responsibilities.

### 3. Analysis Capabilities

1. **Comparative Analysis**: Enhance comparative analysis capabilities to allow easy comparison of similar equipment across different vessels.

2. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Implement more sophisticated historical trend analysis to identify long-term patterns and seasonal variations.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: Add correlation analysis between different parameters to identify relationships and potential root causes of issues.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Consider integrating machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

### 4. Implementation Strategy

1. **Phased Deployment**: Continue with the phased implementation approach, focusing on core functionality first and adding advanced features incrementally.

2. **User Training**: Provide comprehensive training for users to ensure they can fully utilize the enhanced dashboard capabilities.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user input for continuous improvement.

4. **Regular Updates**: Establish a regular update schedule to incorporate new features and improvements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

## Conclusion

The enhanced CBM dashboard represents a significant improvement over the original version, addressing all identified data connection issues and providing a more powerful and user-friendly tool for condition-based monitoring and maintenance planning. The implemented enhancements enable more effective equipment health assessment, trend analysis, and decision-making support.

By following the additional recommendations outlined in this document, the CBM monitoring system can be further improved to provide even more value in terms of predictive maintenance capabilities, operational efficiency, and equipment reliability.

The next steps should focus on user training, gathering feedback from actual usage, and planning for the implementation of the additional recommended enhancements based on priority and available resources.
